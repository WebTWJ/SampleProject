## Project Overview

The goal of the project is to create a smart pen, similar to that used for the [Huion Note](https://www.amazon.com/HUION-Battery-free-Electronic-Note-taking-Refillable/dp/B0BG2T9SGV). The end criteria is to have the pen functionally be able to translate strokes on the paper to a digital medium (most likely vector), and be battery powered. Data proccessing is not expected to occur in the pen, but in a secondary device i.e. a phone or computer. Only data capturing will be done with the pen. Anticipated struggles are: general size constraint, stroke identification, and battery life.

### Design Overview (my plan going in)
- Data gathering, will most likely occur through a 3 axi accel/gyro and a force sensor to pick up when pen is being pushed against paper.
- Data transmission, bluetooth.
- Data processing, harder to decide without access to basic data. General idea is to have a threshold pressure, only after which axi values will be used to compute strokes
- Data output, have rudemintary program where some basic editing can happen before exporting as a pdf.

## Educational Value Added

This project is expected to cover aspects of PCB design, data processing, CAD, and general coding. A custom PCB is expected to have to be made due to the need for minimal size with given components, data processing will be needed to translate raw data from the pen to vector format, and general coding will be needed to turn the processed data into a readable format. CAD design will most likely be needed as well for the pen body.
