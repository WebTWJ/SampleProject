# Summary
The goal of the project is to create a smart pen, similar to that used for the [Huion Note](https://www.amazon.com/HUION-Battery-free-Electronic-Note-taking-Refillable/dp/B0BG2T9SGV). The end criteria is to have the pen functionally be able to translate strokes on the paper to a digital medium (most likely vector), and be battery powered. Data proccessing is not expected to occur in the pen, but in a secondary device i.e. a phone or computer. Only data capturing will be done with the pen. Anticipated struggles are: general size constraint, stroke identification, and battery life.
